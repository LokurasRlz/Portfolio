# Hello Microverse

In this project, I set up a "Hello world" repository. No complex coding was required for this exercise. Our goal here is to master all of the tools and best practices we learned about in previous steps..



## Builted With

-GitHub

-Git

-Visual Code Studio

-Node.js




## Learning Objectives

-Create branches with different base branches.

-Understand the concept of version control.

-Follow GitHub flow.

-Open pull requests in GitHub.

-Write descriptive, easy to understand commit messages.

-Write short, detailed, easy to understand descriptions of pull requests.

-Write a descriptive and easy to understand README in business English for every project submitted.

-Demonstrate an ability to submit a project for code review.





**For this project, we had to get familiar with Github Actions applying Linters to learn how to have cleaner and more profesional codes. Also we had to create a .gitignore file and practice adding new branches to the main repository.** 





## I hope that it fulfill your espectations.
